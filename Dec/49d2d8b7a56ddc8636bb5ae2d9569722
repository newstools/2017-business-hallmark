Justifying the move, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Olufemi Salami who acted on the approval of the Acting Commissioner for Transportation, Anofiu Elegushi, said it had become imperative in view of the need to enforce the state government’s relocation plan for all inter-state buses to be moved from Jibowu to Ojota. The Permanent Secretary reiterated that the state governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, had earlier in the year asked, all transporters operating around the Jibowu and the stretch of Ikorodu Road, to relocate their operations headquarters to Ojota, where the government had provided a land to accommodate them. He maintained that the Ojota luxury bus station was being made ready by a concessionaire with whom government had entered into an agreement to build it with modern facilities, provided, adding that all that the transporters were required to do was to comply with the government’s directive to relocate to the new station. Salami however, insisted that the transporters would be expected to pay the concessionaire before they would be allowed to use the new bus station, but that the amount to be paid would be negotiated.
