 In the finest tradition of Journalism, particularly Business Journalism, hard work, diligence, skill and commitment is rewarded by more hard work, sleepless nights, a corner office and perhaps more mugs of coffee or is it coffee mugs? In this light we have the distinct pleasure of announcing the recent promotion of our erstwhile Business Editor, Okey Onyenweaku, to the position of, Editor, Business Hallmark Newspaper. Onyenweaku has spent several years in the fraternity of business writers penning stories that have riled bankers, flustered regulators and typically kept the business community on its toes realizing that his florid writing style, clinical and clever analysis and his general inquisitiveness would not be assuaged by anything other than a story that unveils truth. He is an avatar of the principle of rigor and transparency, especially in corporate management and financial operations, and therefore he represents a school of newshounds that takes deliberate pride in the art of the craft of news analysis, news gathering and financial education. A recent alumnus of Bloombergâ€™s Business Reporting training programme for Nigerian Journalists and a veteran reporter of several World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) global conferences, Onyenweaku is a seasoned writer, reporter and interpreter of national and global economic events. He brings to his new position a passion for learning, a penchant for research and a rather engaging, and sometimes child-like joy in pealing open the covert activities of business operators. We congratulate our colleague on his appointment and pray that the good Lord continues to increase his knowledge wisdom and understanding while adding several more bottles of drinking water to his new and bigger locker!
